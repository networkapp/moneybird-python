Welcome to moneybird-python's documentation!
============================================

The ``moneybird-python`` package provides a clean interface to the `MoneyBird API <http://developer.moneybird.com/>`_.

The package is aimed at a low level abstraction to make working with the API easier but keep maximum flexibility and
low overhead.

``moneybird-python`` uses the excellent ``requests`` package.
